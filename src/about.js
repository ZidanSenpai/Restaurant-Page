        <p>This Modern Indian Kitchen was born from a love of all things Mumbai. Our founder and chef John Doe spent three amazing years in the City of Dreams, training under the industry's best. She brought home everything she learned - the flavors, the feelings, the family-style cafe - so that you can get a taste of Mumbai, too.</p>
